// What are the key steps in a typical sign-in authentication strategy using Server Actions?

// The sign-in strategy typically involves:
// 1) Receiving email and password inputs,
// 2) Performing form validation using Zod,
// 3) Checking if a user exists with the provided email,
// 4) Validating the password,
// 5) Creating a session by generating a JSON web token and setting it in a cookie if authentication is successful.
